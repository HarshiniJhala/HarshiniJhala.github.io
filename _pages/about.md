I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Minnesota's Bump Lab. I'm studying the biodiversity response to relocating residents from protected areas for my Ph.D. In India, a prominent conservation policy is incentivizing voluntary community migration. My research will focus on finding out if once-inhabited areas recover to the point where they resemble "natural" habitats or if human impacts prevent them from recovering and instead cause them to enter a different steady state. And how long does restoration take, what factors influence it, and what managerial inputs are needed following relocation?
I've worked on conservation and restoration projects in the past, like Bringing the Cheetah Back to India and the Ganges River Dolphin Species Recovery Program.
In 2018, I received my Masters in Conservation Biology from the Durrell Institute of Conservation & Ecology at the University of Kent. My Master's thesis in restoration ecology examined the feasibility of reintroducing grassland megaherbivores (greater one-horned rhino and swamp buffalo) across their historic ranges in south Asia.
